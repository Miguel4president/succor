How I built this app
 - Should have not used brunch, but I did.

1. mix phx.new #{app_name}
2. Update .gitignore

3. mix phx.gen.json Management Team teams name:string
4. edit migration to index + make name unique

5. mix phx.gen.json Management Player players name:string email:string team_id:references:team
6. edit migration: add index...still haven't setup many to many relationship with team yet.

7.
